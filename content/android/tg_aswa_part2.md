### Users roles to use the App

Trainers can briefly discuss the user roles. For more information about user roles. ([Click Here](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-240/configuring-the-system/users-roles-and-groups.html?h=user+2.40#mgt_userrole))

Please note that in this version of the web app, only users with the authority to manage the android settings web app, found under "Other authorities" can edit and access the app.

So to make sure your users have this role, you can go to Users > User role and in this you can select the app authorities as android settings app.

### General Settings:

* General: Defines generic parameters like SMS gateway number and TEI reserved values. 
* An important paramater here is whether or not you allow the user to take screenshots. This may significantly help with troubleshooting in the field. 
* Another important option is the "reserved values." This is used for generating your unique IDs. This option allows you to download pre-generated IDs for the device to use offline. When you come back online, it will refresh your IDs when you sync. Based on the connectivity etc. you should be careful in defining this so people do not run out of IDs when they are working offline. 

### Synchronization:

* Global: It offers additional parameters to control metadata/data synchronization.
  * Sync options that are included here include both the defaults for metadata and data. 
  * You may also want to include a maximum size of a file download if you are on a capped data plan. 
* Programs: This section controls the program data synchronization parameters. It has a section to define global or default parameters to be used in the synchronization of all programs.
  * Note that you can define how many TEIs are downloaded to the device upon syncing.
  * You also have options for defining how many events are downloaded in total
  * It priortizes these downloads based on the date the TEI or event was created
  * These downloads are spread depending on the settings level
* Datasets: Define synchronization parameters for data sets
  * This number determines how many past data sets PER org unit that you are assigned gets downloaded. So a value of 10 could download many more data sets depending on how many org units a person is assigned.
* User sync test: Check how much data a user downloads when syncing and determine if the user can sync everything correctly based on your defined settings
