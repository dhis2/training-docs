# Trainer’s Guide to Android Visual Configuration

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the session "Visual Configuration.” This session follows the standard Academy training approach with

1. a live demo session where the trainer demonstrate and explain the features, and 
   
2. a hands-­on session with exercises where participants get to practice the same features.

This guide will help the trainer​ prepare​​ for the live demo session. The “Live Demo step by
step” section has a detailed walkthrough of all the steps to demonstrate with
explanations and screenshots that should be easy to follow. Use that when preparing for
the live demo session.

There is also a Quick Guide which lists the steps very briefly and this is meant as a lookup
guide or “cheatsheet” WHILE doing the demo, to help the trainer remember all the steps
and the flow of the demo.

## Background

## Preparations

Go through the Live demo step by step guide a few times before doing the actual demo for participants.
Make sure your user account is same or similar to the participants’ training accounts so that you don’t show more features, dimension options or forms than what they can see when doing the exercises.
Make sure the resolution on projector is OK for zooming

Create an account with the same level of access as the users you are demonstrating to (ie. if they can only search and enter within one facility, have your user have the same authority). If it is the procedure to enter this data from a paper form, it will be useful to have a copy of the form they would normally use as reference filled in. This can just be a form that you have filled in yourself for example. If they are entering data in real-time, then this is not required but you should prepare the details of an example case that you can follow in your examples.

For the exercises and small activities during the demo, fill out a couple extra forms that the participants can use to register their own cases. Your training DB should have some existing cases filled in to help support the working list filter, relationships and searching functionality. If demonstrating the working lists functionality, you will need to have a subset of the events you have created and assigned to a user where you can show this functionality.

### APK File

Make sure that you have the app made for training purposes otherwise you will not be able to cast your screen:

This will be denoted by “training” at the end of the APK file.

### Projecting your Android Device

The instructor will have to decide on which method they would like to use to mirror the android app on their computer screen. They will also have to set up a user account (if it doesn’t exist already) that is assigned to the same org unit as the program they are demonstrating.

Please review this CoP post for details on options you may use to mirror your android device:

Scrcpy is another tool that can also be used and is platform agnostic:

### User Account

Ensure that there is a user account assigned to a lower level set of org units at the facility level within the database that you can use prior to performing this session. If the participants are following along, ensure that there are user accounts for them to use as well assigned to lower level organization units. The demo user account is in the academy database is:

Username: android1

Password: District1#

### Participants

Send the instructions to the participants on how to install the Android app prior to the session if they have not yet done so. The instructions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUUUdmPSDycFtdB9yUMq8ZWiWf8gNOu5xvtNj4_V63U/edit?usp=sharing).

Some participant's may not have been able to install the app by themselves. In that scenario, you may need to walk them through how to do this via google play.
