## Background

The APK Distribution app enables implementation administrators to manage and control the version of the Android app, making it easier to manage app updates and ensure compatibility with the DHIS2 system.

Admins will be able to upload the desired version and users will get a prompt message to update when they are not in the last updated version.

Please note that in this version of the Web App, only users with "ALL" authority are able to define the Android app versions. Other users having access to the web app can see the version history list and download the latest version, but cannot edit them.

Note: Versions may change over time. Please use the most up-to-date version when working on this session. The steps below are provided as an example.

## Part 1: Installation of the APK Distribution Web App

* Go to Search Bar and Search for the App Management app

So in this case we want to upgrade to a new version -
3.0

So, for this we will follow the below steps:

* In the **Version** we will add latest version - 3.0
* You need to add a **Minimum Android version** that the app should support which is 5.0.2
* In the **Recommended Android vesrion** we will add 8.0
* In **Download URL** - you can go use 
the Github Link to retrieve the version you need (https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-android-capture-app/releases)
 
  * Select the apk file you want and copy the link. In this scenario, use the training version of the APK file.

* Go back to the DHIS2 web interface and paste the link.
