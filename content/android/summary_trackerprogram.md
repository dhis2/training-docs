# Tracker program - Session Summary

The Tracker Program in the DHIS2 Android app enables mobile data collection for longitudinal tracking of individual data. This feature is essential for monitoring patient health records, tracking immunization schedules, conducting disease surveillance, and more. The DHIS2 Android app supports both event-based programs (without registration) and tracker programs (with registration), allowing users to manage individual data efficiently while offline or online.

## Key Features of Tracker Programs in DHIS2 Android:

1. Individual Registration: The tracker program allows users to register individual participants (such as patients or beneficiaries) in the DHIS2 system. Each registered person is given a unique identifier.

2. Longitudinal Tracking: The tracker program enables the longitudinal tracking of individuals across multiple visits or events. Data can be collected over time, allowing for continuous monitoring of health outcomes.

3. Stages and Events: Tracker programs can be divided into stages, with each stage representing a different part of the program (e.g., initial visit, follow-up visit). Each stage can include multiple data entry forms (events).

4. Offline Data Collection: The DHIS2 Android app supports offline data collection for tracker programs, allowing users to collect data in areas with limited or no internet access. Data can be synced to the DHIS2 server when the device reconnects to the internet.

5. Data Synchronization: Once data is collected offline, it can be synchronized with the central DHIS2 server when the user has internet access. This ensures that all data is stored centrally and can be accessed by program managers and analysts.

6. Program Rules Integration: Program rules can be applied within tracker programs to guide data entry, perform validations, hide/show fields, and provide real-time feedback to users.

7. Follow-Up Alerts: The app can generate alerts for follow-up actions based on the data entered. For example, if a patient needs a follow-up visit, the app can notify the user.

8. Visualization of Individual Data: Users can view individual data in a summarized form, including a timeline of events and key indicators. This helps in understanding the progress and outcomes of the individualâ€™s treatment or participation in the program.

9. Capture and Upload of Files: The DHIS2 Android app allows users to capture and upload files (e.g., photos, documents, or scanned forms) as part of the tracker program.
