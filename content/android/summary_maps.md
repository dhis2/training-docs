# Maps in Android : Session Summary

In the DHIS2 Android app, maps provide users with geospatial insights directly on their mobile devices. This functionality allows users to visualize health data geographically, access important locations, and navigate through regions with data mapped from the DHIS2 system.

## Key Map Features:

1. Offline Maps: This feature is particularly useful in areas with limited or no connectivity, ensuring that users can still navigate and use geospatial data.

2. Data Capture for Enrollment or Event :Allows users to record the exact location of a data collection event, such as a patient visit, vaccination site, or health facility.

3. Display individual data points on the map, such as patient visits, vaccination sites. Each point represents a specific geographic location where data has been collected.
