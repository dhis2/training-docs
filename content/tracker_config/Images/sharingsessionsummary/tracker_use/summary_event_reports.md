# Event Reports - Session Summary

The Event Reports app enables analysis of events in two ways:
1. Pivot table-style analysis with aggregated values of events
2. Lists of events based on queries / filters

There are two table styles in event reports:
1. Pivot : allows us to create aggregate tables based on tracker or event data
2. Line List : allows us to create line lists based on tracker or event data

Along with two output types:
1. Event :  shows data from all events within a single program stage we are working with (including repeated events)
2. Enrollment :  shows data from the most recent event; can combine data across all program stages

We can only show data from multiple stages using the combination of a line list table and an enrollment output type.

## Creating a pivot table event report

2. Select your program, stage and data
3. Define the filters for your data
4. Select your period
5. Select your org unit
6. Modify the layout if needed
7. Update the table to see the output

This type of report will summarize **all events** within a ***single*** program stage, including any repeated events within the stage you have selected.

## Creating a line list table event report
