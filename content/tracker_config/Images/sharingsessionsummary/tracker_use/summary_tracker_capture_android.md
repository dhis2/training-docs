# Android Data Capture - Session Summary

The android data capture app allows us to work with aggregate, event and tracker data. When working with tracker data, it is meant to integrate seamlessly into a program and thus most of the functionality that we are able to perform on the web can also be performed within android data capture. This includes:

   1. Reviewing a list of tracked entities
   1. Searching for tracked entities
   2. Registering tracked entities
   3. Navigating a person's tracked entity dashboard
   4. Entering event data within program stages
   5. Completing an enrollment
   6. Entering relationships

## Working offline

You can perform all of the above operations offline; however you must have any information you are working with downloaded to your device (for example, if you are offline and a TEI has not been downloaded; you will not be able to update the record).

Working offline does have some limitations, especially when you are generating an ID. These ID's are downloaded to the device and it is recommended you do not enter > 500 records offline if you are generating a system ID of some kind.
