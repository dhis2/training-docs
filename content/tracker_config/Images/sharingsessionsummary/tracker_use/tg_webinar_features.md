# Trainer's Guide to Tracker Features (Webinar)

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the webinar “Tracker Feature Overview.”

This session follows the approach of delivering shorter academy sessions that can be accessed by larger audiences (ie. those attending the academy as well as a general audience interested in tracker). A number of guidelines have been adopted from those available for the DHIS 2 Annual Conference.

### Time Requirements

This session should be 2 hours in length including both the presentation as well as Q&A.

## Background

This feature overview is meant to discuss, at a high-level, the key features that are available when working within DHIS2 tracker. While it is a pre-requisite for the tracker use academy, the contents of the webinar are meant for anyone interested in learning about DHIS2 tracker features whether or not they will participate in the tracker use academy.

## Preparations

The presentation for this session is long and covers many different tracker features. If you come across a feature you are not familiar with, please look it up in the documentation, ask within your HISP group or contact me (shurajit@dhis2.org) for any additional explanation.

## Using Zoom

A guideline for the webinar hosts is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kSWcSyqK6cYUR_SPNqrEk5xzRnAR_FRH3-SBkjleqXo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Content of the Presentation

The presentation covers the following topics that you can work through 1-by-1:
- A general overview of tracker
- The capture app
- The tracker capture app
- The android app
- Visualizing tracker data
- Examples of custom apps using tracker data
- Performance improvements
- Planned Features

It may be a good idea to break up your Q&A by these topic areas, as the interactivity of the webinar will be reduced if there is no engagement from the audience.
