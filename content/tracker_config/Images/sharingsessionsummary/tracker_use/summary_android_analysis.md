# Android Analysis - Session Summary

There are different elements on an Android device we can review as it relates to reviewing information for a single TEI. This includes:

1. Reviewing their location on a map
2. Reviewing how repeated stage, numeric data progresses over time
3. Reviewing the output for program indicators
4. Reviewing other feedback that has been configured to be displayed within the tracker dashboard

## Reviewing the location on a map

- In order to review a location of a TEI on a map, there must be co-ordinates collected. If this is not the case, then you will not be able to perform any mapping operations of your TEIs. 
- In order to open a map displaying your TEIs, select your program followed by the maps tab. 
- At the bottom of the map, you will have a carousel that will allow you to cycle through your TEIs. You can expand their details by selecting the arrow button. If you select the record, it will take you to their tracker dashboard.
- You can navigate to their location by selecting the navigation icon directly above the carousel in the maps app. 
- You can alter the type of layers that are displayed on the map by using the layers button in the top right corner of the map
- You can navigate to your current location by selecting the location button in the top right corner of the map

## Reviewing how repeated stage, numeric data progresses over time

- It is possible to display the evolution of data elements as charts, values or tables. This analysis will be available for numeric value types within a repeatable program stage and allows you to view how the values of a data element are changing over time.
- To display the changes of these data element values over time, select a program containing this type of data, open a TEIs record and navigate to the analytics tab.
- This type of output can be displayed as different output types by selecting the options button above the output. After doing so select the output type you want to display.
