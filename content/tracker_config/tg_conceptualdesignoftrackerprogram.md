# **Trainer’s guide to Conceptual Design of Tracker Programs**

## **What is this guide?**

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the session “Conceptual Design for tracker program.” This session follows the standard Academy training approach with 1) a participants reviewing provided registers and forms and 2) preparing presentation slides and documents to present.

This guide will help the trainer​ prepare​​ for the discussions and presentation by participants.

## **Learning Objectives for this session**

* To identify which tools can be implemented as tracker or aggregate for data capture and reporting
* To identify the logical and work flow for the selected tracker implementation
* To identify attributes, data elements and the different stages for the use case
* To share with the group the team’s approach to the use case

## **Time Requirements**

Exercise: 1-1.5 hour(s)

Presentation: ask participants to prepare a 10 minutes presentation of their use cases

## **Background**

Conceptual design is key for participants to apply both events and tracker data models to designing a program.

In this session, the facilitators will prepare a number of tools used in the region, group participants into groups and ask them to discuss as a team and present in plenary.

## **Preparation**

In order to localise this exercise, registers from the host country/participant’s country can be collected and used in this exercise. You should send out a request to participants during the webinar sessions of the academy and evaluate any received registers for use in this exercise. If you receive registers that are long and/or complicated, note that the participants will not be expected to take the whole register and convert its design to something that will work in DHIS2. However, if they can provide an overview and demonstrate they understand the tracker model, that will suffice. 

If it turns out you are unable to find adequate local registers, you may select some from the “registers” folder

## **Steps/instructions**

**Step by step**

* Share the available registers, patient cards and forms with the groups
* Identify and proceed with tools that can be implemented as tracker
* Provide an overview of the desired exercise output
* Requirements from the team
    * A thorough review of the tools
    * Decision of whether to implement a single event or multiple with registration
    * If single
        * Identification of data option sets, data elements and form sections
    * If multiple with registration
        * Identification of registration information and attributes
        * Identification of the different stages, data elements and sections
        * Identification of data option sets, data elements and form sections
    * An excel spreadsheet presentation of the work (data elements, stages, etc…)
    * A powerpoint presentation of the conceptual flow diagram
* Participants present their group work and allow for questions and reactions form the fellow participants
* Facilitators provides concluding remarks at the end of the presentations highlighting the the best and any alternative design if necessary

**NB: If the register they are working with is very long, it is recommended that the group focuses on the following**


1. Identifying the program stages associated with the register
2. Identifying the attributes
3. Identifying the sections within the program stages
4. Identifying where the data elements will go within the program/program stage/section

Identification of individual options/data elements may have to be cut out/cut down due to time restrictions
